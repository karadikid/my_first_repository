# Installfest

## What is Installfest?

Here at General Assembly, we use Installfest to install a group of applications
which we consider essential for any software developer to have. We use these
applications regularly in our classes, and it's essential for all of our
students to have them.

## Things to Keep in Mind

- The instructions below are made for macOS users. For Linux users, please
  follow the instructions [here](./installfest_linux.md) instead.

- Enter the commands in the Terminal unless otherwise noted.

- In the code blocks, do **not** copy the `$` symbols at the start of the line
  unless otherwise noted.

  The `$` is commonly used to represent the start of the prompt in the Terminal,
  and everything that follows the `$` is the command itself.

- We don't recommend typing the commands manually wherever possible, since a
  single typo can make a command malfunction.

  - Use `CMD + C` to copy a command.

  - Use `CMD + V` to paste a command.

  Copy and paste **one command at a time**. Each command should be a single
  line, but if your window is narrow some lines may "wrap" and appear as
  multiple lines.

  For longer lines, make sure you copy the entire line.

- If you're asked to enter your password, that means the password for your
  computer.

  When you type it in, Terminal won't give you any visual feedback to indicate
  you're typing things in: you won't get a black dot for each character you
  typed.

  That's OK â€“ just type your password and hit Enter!

- Terminal is not big on visual feedback â€“ it usually doesn't tell you when
  something worked.

  No news is good news! If you enter a command and Terminal doesn't print
  anything, it probably worked fine.

  If something didn't work, you'll get an error message that gives useful
  information.

- Some of the commands do not give immediate feedback so if it looks like
  something stalled give it a moment.

  If the Terminal prompt (`$`) isn't present on the current line, be patient.

- Your output could be slightly different from the Example Output. As long as
  they are similar you are good to move on to the next step.

- There are a few steps where it is important that a file is saved before
  proceeding. Here are a few things to look out for:

  _Unsaved:_

  ![Unsaved File](./images/file-changes--unsaved.png)

  _Saved:_

  ![Saved File](./images/file-changes--saved.png)

### If You Run Into an Issue

1. First, verify that you've typed the given commands **letter for letter**.
2. Then, check the board if any changes were made during the installfest.
3. Finally, ask an instructor for help.

# Instructions ðŸš€

## Update macOS

For our class, you'll need the latest release of
[macOS Catalina](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-catalina/id1466841314?mt=12).

Starting Installfest with the most recent macOS update is vital!

## Open Terminal

1. Open Spotlight by clicking the little magnifying glass in the top-right
   corner of your screen, or hitting `CMD + Space`.

2. Type "Terminal" into the Spotlight text input and select the Terminal app. A
   new Terminal window should pop up.

## Switch to bash

_Run:_

```sh
# Remember: the "$" is the start of the Terminal prompt!

$ chsh -s /bin/bash
```

### Confirm bash

Close the Terminal completely (`CMD + Q`), then open it again.

## Create .bash_profile

_Run:_

```sh
$ touch ~/.bash_profile
```

### Confirm .bash_profile

```sh
$ source ~/.bash_profile

# Example Output

# Nothing! if you do not get any errors that means the .zshrc is in good shape.
```

## Install Xcode

_Run:_

```sh
$ xcode-select --install
```

### Confirm Xcode

```sh
$ xcode-select --version

# Example Output

xcode-select version 2370.
```

## Install Homebrew

1. Check to see if you have Homebrew installed.

   _Run:_

   ```sh
   $ brew --version

   # Example Output â€“ Homebrew installed

   Homebrew 2.1.9
   Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 9e49; last commit 2019-07-30)

   # Example Output â€“ Homebrew not installed

   -bash: brew: command not found
   ```

2. If Homebrew is installed, update it.

   _Run:_

   ```sh
   $ brew update; brew upgrade; brew cleanup; brew doctor
   ```

   If not, [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

   _Run:_

   ```sh
   $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
   ```

### Confirm Homebrew

```sh
$ brew --version

# Example Output

Homebrew 2.1.16
Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 2d19; last commit 2019-11-06)
```

## (Re)install Git

1. See initial version of git installed on the system.

   _Run:_

   ```sh
   $ git --version

   # Example Output

   git version 2.20.1 (Apple Git-122)
   ```

2. Install latest version of git.

   _Run:_

   ```sh
   $ brew install git
   ```

3. Completely close Terminal (`CMD + Q`) and open a new window with Spotlight.

### Confirm Git

_Run:_

```sh
$ git --version

# Example Output

git version 2.24.0
```

#### Troubleshooting

If the output from the `brew install git` command mentions `brew link git` near
the end, try...

_Run:_

```sh
$ brew link git

# If you get an error message, try:

$ brew link --overwrite git
```

After that, try the Confirm step. If that doesn't work, completely close
Terminal (`CMD + Q`) and open a new window.

## Install Code Editors

We will be using Sublime Text during Installfest, and recommend using it for the
first few weeks before trying out the more complex but powerful editor: VS Code.

_Run:_

```sh
$ brew cask install sublime-text visual-studio-code
```

### Confirm Code Editors

```sh
# 1/2

$ subl ~/.bash_profile

# Keep this window open

# 2/2

$ code ~/.bash_profile
```

You can either use VS Code or Sublime Text to edit your `.bash_profile`. Keep
either window open.

#### Troubleshooting Sublime Text

If Sublime Text is installed but `subl ~/.bash_profile` does not work...

1. _Run:_

```sh
$ ln -sv "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl
```

2. Run the "Confirm" command again. Worst case, completely close Terminal
   (`CMD + Q`) and open a new window.

#### Troubleshooting VS Code

If VS Code is installed but `code ~/.bash_profile` does not work...

1. Anywhere on your computer, press `CMD + Space` to open the Spotlight and type
   "Visual Studio Code" to open the application.

2. In VS Code, press `SHIFT + CMD + P` to open the Command Palette, and enter...

   `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`

   VS Code should autocomplete the rest of the command when you enter the first
   few characters. `

3. Back in the terminal...

   _Run:_

   ```sh
   $ source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

4. Run the "Confirm" command again. Worst case, completely close Terminal
   (`CMD + Q`) and open a new window.

## Remove bash warning

In the `.bash_profile` file open in your editor (Sublime or VS Code), add this
line to the top:

```sh
export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1
```

### Confirm Remove bash warning

```sh
# In the Terminal

$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

**Note:** Installfest provides an
[example `.bash_profile`](./bash_profile_example.sh) with all of additions we'll
be making. It might be helpful to open it in a new browser tab to refer to
alongside the instructions.

## Set the \$PATH

Add the following line to the very top of the `.bash_profile` and then save
(`CMD + S`).

```sh
export PATH="$PATH"
```

_Updated `.bash_profile`:_

```diff
export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1

# The "+" is just to show the added line, it is not a part of the final code.

+ export PATH="$PATH"
```

**Note:** If you already have code in `.bash_profile`, that's awesome! Just make
sure there is a line that says `export PATH="<blah blah blah>"` because we will
need to add to it later.

### Confirm \$PATH

```sh
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Add Git Auto-Completion to bash

In your `.bash_profile`, add this line and save the file (`CMD + S`).

```sh
source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash
```

_Updated `.bash_profile`:_

```diff
export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1
export PATH="$PATH"

+ source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash
```

### Confirm Git Auto-Completion

```sh
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Uninstall Node (if installed)

_Run:_

```sh
$ node --version

# Expected Output â€“ Node not installed

-bash: node: command not found
```

If you get `command not found`, you can move on to the step.

If got any other answer,
[follow these steps to uninstall Node](./uninstall_node.md)!

### Install NVM

**Note:** Save (`CMD + S`) your `.bash_profile` before starting this step â€“ it
will automatically update the `.bash_profile` so we need to save the file first
to avoid file conflicts.

_Run:_

```sh
# 1/2

$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

# 2/2

$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

_Updated `.bash_profile`:_

```diff
export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1
export PATH="$PATH"

source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash

# There might not be an empty line between the previous code and these new lines, feel free to add it in!
+ export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
+ [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
+ [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

```

**_Confirm:_**

```sh
$ command -v nvm

# Example Output

nvm
```

### Install Node

_Run:_

```sh
$ nvm install 13.9.0
```

**_Confirm:_**

```sh
# 1/2

$ node --version

# Example Output

v13.1.0

# 2/2

$ npm --version

# Example Output

v6.12.1
```

## Install Pyenv

[Source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)

**Note:** Save (`CMD + S`) your `.bash_profile` before starting this step â€“ it
will update the `.bash_profile` so we need to save the file first to avoid file
conflicts.

1. _Run:_

   ```sh
   $ brew install pyenv
   ```

2. Add to `.bash_profile`:

   ```sh
   if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
     eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   fi
   ```

   _Updated `.bash_profile`:_

   ```diff
   # In .bash_profile
   export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1
   export PATH="$PATH"

   source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash

   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

   + if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
   +   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   + fi

   ```

3. _Run (in Terminal):_

   ```sh
   $ source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

### Confirm pyenv

```sh
$ pyenv --version

# Example Output

pyenv 1.2.15
```

## Install Python

_Run:_

```sh
# 1/3

$ pyenv install 3.8.0

# 2/3

$ pyenv global 3.8.0

# 3/3

$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Confirm python

```sh
$ python --version

# Example Output

Python 3.8.0
```

#### Troubleshooting

Refer the the [pyenv wiki](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki)

## Update pip

_Run:_

```sh
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

While we're here...

```sh
$ pip install ipython
```

## Install Pipenv

_Run:_

```sh
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

### Confirm pipenv

```sh
$ pipenv --version

# Example Output â€“ Success

pipenv, version 2018.11.26

# Example Output â€“ More work needed

-bash: pipenv: command not found
```

#### Troubleshooting pipenv

If pipenv cannot be found, we need to make one change to the `.bash_profile` so
the Terminal can find the application.

How do we determine what to change the line to?

1. We need to find the location we need to add to our `$PATH`.

   _Run:_

   ```sh
   $ python -m site --user-base
   ```

   This will give us a location such as...

   ```sh
   /Users/<your_user_REPLACE_THIS>/.local

   # Yours will be different!
   ```

2. We want to add "/bin" to this location when we add it to the `$PATH`. So in
   in this example, we'd get...

   ```diff
   - /Users/<your_user_REPLACE_THIS>/.local
   + /Users/<your_user_REPLACE_THIS>/.local/bin
   ```

   Just make a note of this line, we will add it to the `.bash_profile` in the
   next step.

3. Update your `.bash_profile` by adding this path to the `export PATH` line.

   Keep the final `:$PATH` at the very end, and insert the location of the
   pipenv installation immediately before it.

   **Note:** be mindful of the `:`s between different file locations in the
   `$PATH`

   The updated line could look something like...

   _Update `.bash_profile`:_

   ```diff
   # In .bash_profile
   export BASH_SILENCE_DEPRECATION_WARNING=1
   - export PATH="$PATH"
   + export PATH="/Users/<your_user_REPLACE_THIS>/.local/bin:$PATH"

   source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash

   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

   ```

### Confirm pipenv Troubleshooting

```sh
# 1/2

$ source ~/.bash_profile

# 2/2

$ pipenv --version

# Example Output

pipenv, version 2018.11.26
```

## Install Postgres

[Source](https://postgresapp.com/)

1. _Run:_

   ```sh
   # 1/2

   $ brew cask install postgres

   # 2/2

   $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d && echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp
   ```

2. Completely close Terminal and reopen a new window.

3. Use Spotlight (`CMD + Space`) and type "Postgres" to open the application.

   If this is the first time running Postgres.app, click the "Initialize"
   button. This will create the database and start your local server.

### Confirm Postgres

```sh
$ psql

# Example Output

psql (12.0)
Type "help" for help.

```

This opens a new type of prompt in Terminal, type `\q` and then hit Enter to
exit.
